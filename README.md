# Getting started with Data Science

This is a repository for the Intro to Data Science workshop at Tech Rebalanced 2018. 

If you would like to code along, please make sure you have *Anaconda with Python 3.7* installed. You can download Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and follow instructions for setup on a Mac [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/) and on Windows [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/).

Anaconda comes with both Pandas and Jupyter notebook. It also comes with other packages for data science, including statsmodels and scikit-learn.

If you have any questions or notice any errors in the code, please let me know! You can find me on Twitter @mostlyinane or shoot me an email at ritika.s.bhasker (at) gmail.
